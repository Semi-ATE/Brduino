# Brduino-Nano

Brduino-Nano is a 'jeux de mots Vis-Ã -vis' [Arduino-Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano)

Whereas the Arduino Nano is based on the [8-Bit ATmega328 controller from Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328), the Brduino Nano is based on the [32-Bit Arm Cortex M4 from NXP](https://www.nxp.com/part/MK22FN512VLH12#/).

Below a quick comparison of the Arduino-Nano against the Brduino-Nano
