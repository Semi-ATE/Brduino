# Brduino-Nano

Brduino-Nano is a 'jeux de mots Vis-Ã -vis' [Arduino-Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano).

It is an open-source project that brings the Arduino-Nano form-factor into this century. :sunglasses:  

Whereas the Arduino Nano is based on the [8-Bit ATmega328](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328) controller from [Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/), the Brduino Nano is based on the [32-Bit Arm Cortex M4](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m4) from [NXP](https://www.nxp.com/part/MK22FN512VLH12#/). The footprint of the Arduino-Nano and the Brduino-Nano are identical, as a matter of fact for plenty of applications the Brduino-Nano is a drop-in replacement for the Arduino-Nano.

Below a quick comparison of the Arduino-Nano against the Brduino-Nano :

The Brduino ofcourse doesn't use the ugly [arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) but the [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) based [MCUXpresso](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE) :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

Connecting from your IDE to the Brduino is done via a [JLink](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/model-overview/), but we advise to go for the [JLink Pro](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-pro/) in combination with the [10-Pin Needle Adapter](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/accessories/adapters/10-pin-needle-adapter/) as the Brduino holds such a connector.

The project is realized in [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer/), but, as the gerbers are included in the repo, you can produce the Brduino yourself without having Altium license(s), or alternatively you can contact [Thomas Arul](thomasarul@likom.com.my) at [Likom](http://www.likom.com.my/) to get a quote for these things.
