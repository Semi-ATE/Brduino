# Brduino-Nano

Brduino-Nano is a 'jeux de mots Vis-Ã -vis' [Arduino-Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano).

Whereas the Arduino Nano is based on the [8-Bit ATmega328 controller from Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328), the Brduino Nano is based on the [32-Bit Arm Cortex M4 from NXP](https://www.nxp.com/part/MK22FN512VLH12#/). The footprint of the Arduino-Nano and the Brduino-Nano are identical, as a matter of fact for plenty of applications the Brduino-Nano is a drop-in replacement for the Arduino-Nano.

Below a quick comparison of the Arduino-Nano against the Brduino-Nano :

The Brduino ofcourse doesn't use the ugly [arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) but the [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) based [MCUXpresso](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE) :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

Connecting from your IDE to the Brduino is done via a [JLink](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/model-overview/), but we advise to go for the [JLink Pro](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-pro/) in combination with the [10-Pin Needle Adapter](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/accessories/adapters/10-pin-needle-adapter/) as the Brduino holds such a connector.
